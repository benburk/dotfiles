# Bootstrapping macOS

How I configure my Mac and other devices for getting things done.

# Clean start

I factory reset my computer once a year in order to
- test & evaluate backup strategies
- consider which tools and applications I still like using in my workflow
- clear out loose files and cruft that have accumulated on my system
- upgrade the operating system without breaking things
- make the computer feel like new

macOS Monterey made it easier to reset a Mac using the "Erase All Content and Settings" feature. [Apple Guide](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212749)


# Command line tools

The Command line tools package from Apple provides several development tools, including the Apple LLVM compiler, linker, and Make. The list of tools can be found in the folder `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/`.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

# Zsh

Since macOS Catalina, `zsh` comes installed as the default shell. I use the [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) framework for configuration and plugins.
```bash
# 1. Install oh-my-zsh (https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

# 2. Download zsh plugins
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

# Homebrew

Homebrew provides a convenient way to install, update, and delete command line tools and applications.

```bash
# 1. Install homebrew (https://brew.sh)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# 2. Install command line tools I like
brew install rg fd fzf git vale helix tree
/usr/local/opt/fzf/install  # fzf setup

# Quick-look plugins https://www.quicklookplugins.com
brew install --cask qlcolorcode qlstephen

# Utilities
brew install --cask karabiner-elements keepassxc iina qbittorrent cryptomator logisim-evolution selfcontrol

# Applications
brew install --cask telegram visual-studio-code obsidian nordvpn orion jellyfin deezer
```

# Programming

## Rust

```bash
# https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install formatting tool
rustup component add rustfmt
```

## Python

For managing multiple Python versions, use `pyenv`.

```bash
brewÂ installÂ python

# linting dependencies
pip install "black==22.8.0" "isort==5.10.1" "mypy==0.991" "pylint==2.15.3" "pytest==7.1.3" "pytest-cov==3.0.0" "refurb" "doctest"
```

## C++

```bash
brew install cmake conan llvm
```

# Dotfiles

At one point, I tried to make everything work out of `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Inevitably, one tool wouldn't respect it and break the convention. I have since opted to define my own dotfile structure and then symlink the files to their appropriate locations.

There exist many [programs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles#Tools) to manage dotfiles, but I prefer the simplicity and control of my current setup.

```bash
mkdir ~/dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/chariotsofiron/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
./dotfiles/install_dotfiles
```


# System preferences

The `defaults` command can configure these preferences programmatically. I might move to that. [Example](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos)

```

## Safari
